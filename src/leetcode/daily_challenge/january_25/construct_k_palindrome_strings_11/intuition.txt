You don't need to construct k plaindrome. Just you need to check, is it possible or not. 

In this case what you can do, try to check the false cases first then rest are true cases.

False cases are
    * if number of palindrome string is greater than number of characters (which is obvious! right?!)
    * if number of odd number of character in the string is greater than k then you'll not be able to construct k palindrome. 
    remember: you can add at most one odd count character in a palindrome string.
