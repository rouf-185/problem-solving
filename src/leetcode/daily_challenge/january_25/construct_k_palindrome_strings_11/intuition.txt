You don't need to construct k plaindromes. Just you need to check that is it possible or not? 

In this problem what you can do, try to check the false cases first then rest are true cases.

False cases are
    * if the number of palindrome string (k) is greater than number of characters (which is obvious! right?!)
    * if the number of odd number of character in the string is greater than k then you'll not be able to construct k palindrome. 
    remember: you can add at most one odd count character in a palindrome string. 

Rest are true!
