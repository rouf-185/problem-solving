1) Compile
   Compile the Java sources (from the project root):

   javac Main.java

2) Run
   Run the program and pass the input file. If your assignment requires a UCFID, pass it as the second argument.

   java Main Data.txt 5745827

3) Optional: demo mode
   Use the included `Toy.txt` input to run a small demo that prints all-pairs shortest paths:

   java Main Toy.txt

Special Notes
- Run the commands from the project directory where `Main.class` and input files live.
- If you see a "class not found" error, ensure you compiled successfully and are in the same folder as `Main.class` when running `java`.
